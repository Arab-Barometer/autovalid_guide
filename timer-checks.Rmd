# Timer Checks

The `autovalid()` function performs ten checks related to time and gives an overall score. The results are in the columns:

- **`CHECK_TIMER1_AFTER_9AM`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER1_BEFORE_8PM`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER1_ABOVE_MIN`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER1_BELOW_MAX`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER2_ABOVE_MIN`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER2_BELOW_MAX`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER3_ABOVE_MIN`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER3_BELOW_MAX`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER4_ABOVE_MIN`**
- **`CHECK_TIMER4_BELOW_MAX`**
- **`SCORE_TIMER`**

## Understanding the Four Timers

`autovalid()` uses four different measures of time to calculate the length of a survey. These timers are called" `TIMER1`, `TIMER2`, `TIMER3`, and `TIMER4`.

### `TIMER1`

`TIMER1` is calculated from the `start` and `end` time recorded in the survey.
These times are found in the raw data.

The other three timers are all calculated from the audit files.

### `TIMER2`

`TIMER2` is calculated using the last recorded `start` and first recorded `start` in the associated interview's audit file. 

All elements in an audit file have a `start` value, but not all have an `end` value, so that is why only values from the `start` column are used.

### `TIMER3`

`TIMER3` is calculated using the sum of the time spent on each page of the survey, according to the audit file.

Once the survey and audit file timers start, they do not stop. If an interviewer leaves a survey and returns to it the duration of the survey may appear longer than it actually was. This timer does not include such pauses.

### `TIMER4`

`TIMER4` is calculated using the sum of the time spent on each page of the survey for questions that are between the first and last substantive question.

By default, the first substantive question is set to `"Q2061A"` and the last substantive question is determined as the last question that begins with `"Q"`.
