This guide should serve as a reference for how to use the autovalid package and how to understand the results.

There are four steps to run all the validation tests in autovalid. Load the necessary libraries. These libraries are readxl and autovalid. Load the raw data and save the path to the zip files. The zip files are NOT loaded. Only save the path. Use the prep_data() function from autovalid to create the object that will be used for validation. Run the autovalid() function on the output of prep_data(). Make sure to save the output to an object. The output of the function autovalid() contains the results of all the validation tests. Ultimately, if you follow the four steps, your code should follow the example of the following code block: #.........................Load Libraries......................... library(readxl) library(autovalid) #......................Load data and paths....................... raw_country_data &lt;- read_xls(&quot;path/to/raw/data.xlsx&quot;) audit_files &lt;- &quot;path/to/audits.zip&quot; #..........................Prep the data......................... prepped_data &lt;- prep_data(raw_country_data, audit_files) #..........................Run autovalid......................... validation_output &lt;- autovalid(prepped_data) Now that we have the results, we need to know how to understand them. A majority of the rest of the guide is dedicated to explaining the output of the autovalid() function.
