This guide should serve as a reference for how to use the autovalid package and how to understand the results. "],["basic-use.html", "Chapter 2 Basic Use", " Chapter 2 Basic Use This chapter sheds light on how to use the autovalid package at the most basic level. There are four steps to run all the validation tests in autovalid. Load the necessary libraries. These libraries are readxl and autovalid. Load the raw data and save the path to the zip files. The zip files are NOT loaded. Only save the path. Use the prep_data() function from autovalid to create the object that will be used for validation. Run the autovalid() function on the output of prep_data(). Make sure to save the output to an object. The output of the function autovalid() contains the results of all the validation tests. Ultimately, if you follow the four steps, your code should follow the example of the following code block: #.........................Load Libraries......................... library(readxl) library(autovalid) #......................Load data and paths....................... raw_country_data &lt;- read_xls(&quot;path/to/raw/data.xlsx&quot;) audit_files &lt;- &quot;path/to/audits.zip&quot; #..........................Prep the data......................... prepped_data &lt;- prep_data(raw_country_data, audit_files) #..........................Run autovalid......................... validation_output &lt;- autovalid(prepped_data) Now that we have the results, we need to know how to understand them. A majority of the rest of the guide is dedicated to explaining the output of the autovalid() function. "],["timer-checks.html", "Chapter 3 Timer Checks 3.1 Understanding the Four Timers 3.2 Time of Day", " Chapter 3 Timer Checks The autovalid() function performs ten checks related to time and gives an overall score. The results are in the columns: CHECK_TIMER1_AFTER_9AM CHECK_TIMER1_BEFORE_8PM CHECK_TIMER1_ABOVE_MIN CHECK_TIMER1_BELOW_MAX CHECK_TIMER2_ABOVE_MIN CHECK_TIMER2_BELOW_MAX CHECK_TIMER3_ABOVE_MIN CHECK_TIMER3_BELOW_MAX CHECK_TIMER4_ABOVE_MIN CHECK_TIMER4_BELOW_MAX SCORE_TIMER 3.1 Understanding the Four Timers autovalid() uses four different measures of time to calculate the length of a survey. These timers are called” TIMER1, TIMER2, TIMER3, and TIMER4. 3.1.1 TIMER1 TIMER1 is calculated from the start and end time recorded in the survey. These times are found in the raw data. The other three timers are all calculated from the audit files. 3.1.2 TIMER2 TIMER2 is calculated using the last recorded start and first recorded start in the associated interview’s audit file. All elements in an audit file have a start value, but not all have an end value, so that is why only values from the start column are used. 3.1.3 TIMER3 TIMER3 is calculated using the sum of the time spent on each page of the survey, according to the audit file. Once the survey and audit file timers start, they do not stop. If an interviewer leaves a survey and returns to it the duration of the survey may appear longer than it actually was. This timer does not include such pauses. 3.1.4 TIMER4 TIMER4 is calculated using the sum of the time spent on each page of the survey for questions that are between the first and last substantive question. By default, the first substantive question is set to \"Q2061A\" and the last substantive question is determined as the last question that begins with \"Q\". 3.2 Time of Day autovalid() uses the time recorded in the "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
