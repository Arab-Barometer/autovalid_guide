These major tests include considerations for interview duration, missing data, percent match, location discrepancies, and straightlining. This chapter describes the different parameters in the function that can be adjusted for your specific analysis. The major tests in the parse_for_major_flags() are: timer_fail_count thresh_max_miss thresh_max_pct do_timer do_variance do_percent_match do_missingness do_location 4.1 timer_fail_count timer_fail_count uses the 4 timers in the autovalid() function to flag time duration issues. The default input is 3 and can go up to 4 timers. 4.2 thresh_max_miss thresh_max_miss is the threshold for the maximum acceptable missingness percentage in an interview. The default is 0.15. 4.3 thresh_max_pct thresh_max_miss determines the threshold for maximum acceptable percent match across interviews. The default is 0.85. 4.4 do_timer The do_timer parameter flags interviews that are too short and is set TRUE by default. Set do_timer to FALSE to exclude timer checks from the analysis. 4.5 do_variance The do_variance parameter flags straightlining and is set TRUE by default. Set do_variance to FALSE to exclude straightlining checks from the analysis. 4.6 do_percent_match The do_percent_match parameter flags high percent match and is set TRUE by default. Set do_percent_match to FALSE to exclude percent match checks from the analysis. 4.7 do_missingness The do_missingness parameter flags high levels of missing responses in an interivew and is set to TRUE by default. Set do_missingness to FALSE to exclude missingness checks from your analysis. 4.8 do_location The do_location parameter flags questionable locations and is set to TURE by default. Set do_location to FALSE to exclude location checks from the analysis.

The output of parse_for_major_flags() include data frame with information about interviews that fail one or more of the major tests, validation checks, and identifies interviews to refield. The output looks like this list: refield_report (data frame) refield_validation_results (data frame) refield_interviews (data frame) 5.1 refield_report refield_report a data frame that provides information about interviews that failed one or more major tests. The output columns are: _UUID: Unique identifier for each interview Internal_ID: Internal identifier for the interview Date: Date of the interivew Interviewer_ID: ID of the interview Interviewer_Name: Name of the interviewer Reasons: Details about the reasons for failure, such as being too short, having high missingness, etc. 5.2 refield_validation_results refield_validation_results provides a summary of the major validation checks for each flagged interview. It includes the total number of flags as well as information about timers, missingness, percent match, location checks, and variance checks. This table gives a concise view of the validation results for flagged interviews. 5.3 refield_interviews refield_interviews includes a subset of the original interview data but only for the interviews that failed one or more major tests. It allows for a detailed examination of the responses and characteristics of the flagged interviews.
